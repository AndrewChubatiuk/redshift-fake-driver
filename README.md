# redshift-fake-driver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opt-tech/redshift-fake-driver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opt-tech/redshift-fake-driver)

redshift-fake-driver is a JDBC driver accepting Redshift specific commands (e.g. COPY, UNLOAD), which is useful for local testing.
The driver uses `AWS SDK for Java` to connect to S3, so you can use mocking libraries to emulate S3. (e.g. [fake-s3](https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3))
